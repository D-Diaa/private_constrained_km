"""
Package for visualization and analysis of clustering algorithm performance.

This package provides a comprehensive set of tools for visualizing and analyzing
the performance of various clustering algorithms. It includes modules for:

- Ablation studies (ablation_plots.py)
- Timing analysis (timing_analysis.py)
- Per-dataset performance visualization (per_dataset.py)
- Synthetic data bar plots (synthetic_bar.py)
- Scalability heatmaps (scale_heatmap.py)

Each module is designed to handle specific aspects of the analysis and visualization
pipeline, supporting both privacy-preserving and traditional clustering methods.
