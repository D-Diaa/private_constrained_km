# Privacy-Preserving Federated Clustering

A framework for performing federated k-means clustering with differential privacy guarantees.

## Features
- Federated k-means clustering implementation
- Multiple privacy preservation mechanisms:
  - Laplace mechanism (ε-differential privacy)
  - Gaussian mechanism ((ε,δ)-differential privacy)
  - Secure multi-party computation via masking
- Configurable communication simulation (LAN/WAN latency)
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Experiment framework for reproducible research

## Architecture
- Server: Coordinates clustering and applies privacy mechanisms
- Clients: Perform local computations and mask sensitive data
- Communication: MPI-based message passing with configurable delays
- Privacy Layer: Differential privacy mechanisms and secure aggregation

## Evaluation Metrics
- NICV (Normalized Inter-Cluster Variance)
- WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)
- BCSS (Between-Cluster Sum of Squares)
